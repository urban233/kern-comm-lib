The repository contains the Kern Python library code. 
Kern (`kern-comm-lib`) is an open-source collection of Python code designed to augment the Python standard library.
It provides robust, exception-free Python utilities for building reliable applications
and features modern error handling with `Status` and `StatusOr` to eliminate runtime surprises.

> APIs will (greatly) evolve until v1.0.

## Features ‚ú®  
- **Exception-Free Modules**: Predictable error handling without `try/except` sprawl.  
- **Status & StatusOr**: Modern result types for explicit success/failure handling.
- **Thread-safe Logging**: Log messages with thread safety and flexibility.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è  
```bash
pip install kern-comm-lib
```

## Design Philosophy
The core idea of Kern is to provide an exception-free alternative to common
standard libraries of Python. Kern is divided into two major parts: (1) the 
`base` package and (2) other high-level packages (e.g. filesystem). 
The `base` package is the standard every other high-level package uses. For 
example, the `base` package contains the `log` and `status` package which 
should be used in a high-level package like `filesystem` that wraps filesystem
functions of the standard library in an exception-free way. Therefore, the
high-level packages are consumers of the `base` package and should it import 
like any other user with `import kern_comm_lib as kern`.
